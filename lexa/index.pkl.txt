Organs of Respiratory System
LungAlveoli
(Balloon shaped air sacs)Organs in the Respiratory System
STRUCTURE FUNCTION
Nose / nasal cavity Warms, moistens, &filters airasitisinhaled
Pharynx (throat) Passageway forair,leads totrachea
Larynx Thevoice box, where vocal cords arelocated
Trachea (windpipe)Trachea islined with finehairs called cilia which filter
airbefore itreaches thelungs
BronchiTwo branches attheendofthetrachea, each lead to
alung
BronchiolesAnetwork ofsmaller branches leading from the
bronchi intothelung tissue &ultimately toairsacs
AlveoliThe functional respiratory units inthelung where
gases areexchanged
DiaphragmAdome -shaped muscle thatseparates thelungs from
theabdomenLungsFunctional division of respiratory system
Two parts :
1)Conductive zone :main function istofilter, warm, andmoisten
airand conduct itinto thelungs .These include nose, nasal cavity,
pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles .
2)Respiratory zone :main sites forgas exchange between air
andblood .These include bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs and
alveoli .
What is breathing?
‚ñ™It is a physical process by which organisms obtain oxygen from the air and 
release carbon dioxide.
What is cellular respiration?Respiration process: Breathing and cellular 
respirationRespiration process and its four events 
Pulmonary 
ventilation External 
respiration 
or 
pulmonary 
exchange of 
gasesRespiratory gas 
transportInternal respiration 
or Systemic 
exchange of gases 
Pulmonary Ventilation/Breathing
‚Ä¢Pulmonary ventilation isamechanical process depends onvolume changes inthethoracic
cavity .Volume changes lead topressure changes, which leads totheflow ofgases to
equalize pressure .
‚Ä¢Two phases ofpulmonary ventilation/breathing
‚û¢Inhalation (Inspiration), and
‚û¢Exhalation (Expiration)
Inspiration :During inspiration (inhalation),
thediaphragm and intercostal muscles
contract due towhich there isexpansion
ofribcage and lungs and increase in
thoracic cavity .External airispulled into
thelungs duetoincrease inthevolume of
thoracic cavity .
Exhalation :During exhalation, intercostal muscles relax .The diaphragm moves upwards due
towhich ribcage contracts and lungs arecompressed .Asaresult, airispushed outofthe
lungs .
‚ùñExternal respiration /Pulmonary exchange ofgases istheexchange ofgases
between oxygen intheairand blood capillaries inthealveoli .Diffusion ofgases
between lungs -alveoli andblood .
‚Ä¢Oxygen diffuses from alveoli intoblood .
‚Ä¢Carbon dioxide simultaneously diffuses inopposite direction .
Blood haslowPO2(40mmHg)while PO2inalveoli airis104mmHg.
Blood hashigh CO2(45mmHg)compared toalveoli air(40mmHg).
‚ùñInternal respiration/Systemic exchange ofgases istheexchange ofgases
between blood andbody tissues .Cells useoxygen constantly forcellular respiration
sopartial pressure intissue islow.Tissue produce large quantities ofCO2as
biochemical waste products sopartial pressure ishigh.External respiration and internal respiration‚Ä¢Pulmonary exchange ofgases (between lungs and blood) and
Systemic exchange ofgases (between blood andbody tissues)
Transport of respiratory gases
1) Oxygen transport from lungs to body tissues
2) Carbon -dioxide transport from body tissues to lungs
Transport of respiratory gases in the blood
‚Ä¢O2+Fe2+-Haemoglobin (Hb)‚Üí
HbO2(oxyhemoglobin) ---98.5%
‚Ä¢Oxyhemoglobin carries 1-4
molecules ofoxygen depending onits
degree ofsaturation .
‚Ä¢Oxyhemoglobin does notdissociate
intheblood vessel, until itreaches a
tissue with low Po2(partial pressure
ofoxygen) .
‚Ä¢Indissolved state ,only 3%oxygen is
transported tothetissues .
Oxygen transport1.Indissolved state inplasma -5-7%istransported indissolved state .Upon
reaching thelungs, itdiffuses intoalveolar airandexhaled .
2.Bicarbonate ions:70%CO2istransported intheform ofbicarbonate ions.
‚Ä¢CO2(from tissues) +H2O(water inerythrocytes) ÔÉõ H2CO3(Carbonic acid)
reaction iscatalyzed byenzyme Carbonic anhydrase which ispresent in
erythrocytes .
‚Ä¢ H2CO3ÔÉõH++ HCO3-
‚Ä¢Carbonic acid that isformed immediately dissociates into Bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).
Bicarbonate ions diffused into theplasma and reacts with sodium ions toform sodium
bicarbonate (NaHCO3-).Inexchange ofHCO3-,chloride ions move from plasma into the
RBCs .This exchange ofnegative ions, which maintains theelectrical balance between blood
plasma andRBC cytosol, isknown aschloride shift.
3.Carbamino -haemoglobin -23%ofCO2reacts with amine group ofglobin part of
haemoglobin (Hb) forming carbamino -haemoglobin (HbCO2)Carbon -dioxide transport from tissues to lungsGas exchange at tissues level
(Oxygen release and carbon dioxide pick up)
Haemoglobinic 
acid (HHb), 
helps in 
buffering 
excess H+ions 
and allowing O2 
to be releasedOxygen -haemoglobin dissociation curve (ODC) showing the 
relationship between hemoglobin saturation and Po2at 
normal body temperature
‚Ä¢When Po2 ishigh, the more O2
combines with hemoglobin andisalmost
100%saturation .
‚Ä¢When Po2islow, hemoglobin isonly
partially saturated .
‚Ä¢Inpulmonary capillaries ,where Po2is
high, alotofO2binds tohemoglobin .In
tissue capillaries, where thePo2islower
(40mm Hg), hemoglobin does nothold
asmuch oxygen anddissolved Oxygen
isunloaded viadiffusion intotissue cells.
‚Ä¢Hemoglobin isstill75%saturated with
O2ataPo2of40mm Hg,theaverage
Po2oftissue cells inaperson atrest.
That means only 25%oftheavailable O2
unloads from hemoglobin andisused by
tissue cells under resting conditions .Haemoglobin -oxygen binding

tothe next.Children/offspring resemble their parents because they
inherit traits passed down from both parents .
‚Ä¢Thebranch ofbiology thatdeals withinheritance iscalled genetics .
What is inheritance?Some terminologies in principles of inheritance
‚Ä¢Homologous chromosomes :The nuclei ofallhuman cells except gametes
contain 23pairs ofchromosomes -thediploid number (2n).One chromosome
ineach paircame from themother andtheother came from thefather .
‚Ä¢Gene locus :thelocation ofagene onachromosome, orwithin aDNA
molecule, iscalled gene locus .
Forexample :‚ÄúT‚Äùlocus ,means gene Tlocation onachromosome .Gene T
codes forafunctional protein orenzyme .
‚Ä¢Alleles :ADNA sequence atthe‚ÄòT‚Äôlocus thathasundergone mutation may
nolonger encode afunctional enzyme .Following amutation, thelocus
remains same, buttheDNA sequence atmutant locus isdifferent .So,
different DNA sequences atthesame locus arecalled different alleles ofthe
same gene .Anychange intheDNA sequence ofgene creates new allele .‚Ä¢Example to understand the concept of alleles:
Trait :  Color of flower
Purple flower  (P)                                   White flower (p)
No pigmentation, absence of anthocyanin Purple pigmentation due to anthocyanin
No functional enzymePurple color isformed duetoa
specific functional enzyme
DNA sequence at‚ÄúPlocus‚Äù mutated for
thefunctional enzyme forproduction of
anthocyanin .mutated version isnow
called here as‚Äúp‚Äùallele .DNA sequence at‚ÄúPlocus‚Äù
forthefunctional
enzyme forproduction
ofanthocyanin‚Ä¢Genotype :genetic composition ofanorganism fortheparticular trait.
‚Ä¢Phenotype :The external appearance ofanorganism due toitsgenetic
composition/influence ofgenes andenvironmental factors .
‚Ä¢Homozygous :theindividuals having identical alleles inanallelic pairfora
character orsame alleles ofagene atthe gene locus iscalled
homozygous condition .
‚Ä¢Example :‚ÄúPP‚Äù forpurple color and‚Äúpp‚Äùforwhite color .
‚Ä¢Heterozygous :theindividuals having different alleles inanallelic pairfor
acharacter ordifferent alleles ofagene atthegene locus iscalled
heterozygous condition .
‚Ä¢Example :‚ÄúPp‚Äùforpurple color .
‚Ä¢Dominant allele :Ifoutoftwodifferent allele ofagene atthelocus, one
allele isexpressed, forms afunctional product, andshows itsphenotypic
effect inevery generation, then thatallele isknown tobedominant over
theother allele .
‚Ä¢Forexample, genetic make upofplant with‚ÄúPp‚Äù giving purple flower
means‚ÄúP‚Äùallele isdominant over‚Äúp‚Äùallele .
‚Ä¢Recessive allele :Ifoutoftwodifferent allele ofagene atthelocus, one
allele isnotexpressed, ordonotform anyfunctional product, then that
allele isknown toberecessive over theother alleleThree pairs of

Two alleles in ‚ÄúS‚Äù and 
‚Äús‚Äù in homologous 
chromosomeCodominance/multiple -allele inheritance
‚Ä¢Codominance :Both thealleles atthegene locus shows itsindependent affect .‚ÄúABO‚Äù
‚Äìlocus thatdetermines theblood group ofanindividual .
‚Ä¢ABO locus hasthree major alleles -ABO*A ;ABO*B ;ABO*O .Also represented asIA,IB
,IO.
‚ùñAt‚ÄúABO‚Äù gene locus ofanindividual, two alleles arepresent and therefore, six
genotypes arepossible .(AandBalleles aredominant while Oisrecessive)

IAIOIBIB IBIOIAIBIOIOChromosomal location of ABO blood group alleles 
Why blood group alleles are codominant and not dominant?
‚Ä¢Person having blood group Ahas‚ÄúA-antigen‚Äù onitsRBC‚Äôs surface,
‚Ä¢Blood group Bhas‚ÄúB-antigen‚Äù onitssurface ,
‚Ä¢Blood group ABhas both ‚ÄúAand Bantigens‚Äù expressed onRBC
surface,
‚Ä¢Ohas‚Äúnoantigens‚Äù onRBC surface .
‚Ä¢Thecodominant effect ofalleles isduetotheequal expression ofAand
Bantigens ontheRBC surface .
‚Ä¢Noallele isdominant over other ormasks theexpression ofother .
Therefore, blood group alleles show thecodominance phenomenon‚Ä¢The human Xchromosome contains many genes that arerequired inboth sexes,
whereas Ychromosome contains only afew genes, primarily genes related to
maleness .
‚Ä¢About 200traits have been estimated tobeX-linked compared toafew,which areY-
linked .
‚Ä¢The traits controlled bygenes located onXchromosome areoften called sex-linked
genes, orX-linked traits .
‚Ä¢Females have twodoses ofX-linked genes (because twoX-chromosome) andmales
have only onedose .
Female genotype : XX; males genotype : XY
‚Ä¢One dose ofX-linked dominant allele produces itseffects inmales aswellasfemales
Forexample :XHXXHY;where ‚ÄúH‚Äùisthedominant allele andwillshow itseffect onboth
males andfemales .
‚Ä¢Iftheallele isX-linked recessive ,then female willshow thephenotypic effect only when both
X-chromosome hastheallele, while males willshow thephenotypic effect duetopresence of
only oneX-chromosome
‚Ä¢forexample :XhX XhY;where ‚Äúh‚Äùistherecessive allele andwillshow itsphenotypic
effect only inmales while females willbethecarrier ofrecessive allele .Females willshow its
effect only when both theX-chromosome carries therecessive allele .X-linked inheritanceInheritance pattern of X and Y

example of X -linked recessive inheritance
‚Ä¢Red-green color blindness condition ischaracterized byadeficiency in
either red-or-green -sensitive cones .
‚Ä¢Therefore, redand green areseen assame color (either redorgreen,
depending onwhich cone ispresent) .
‚Ä¢Thegene forred-green color blindness isarecessive onedesignated as‚Äúc‚Äù.
Normal color vision ,designated as‚ÄúC‚Äùdominates .
‚Ä¢The C/cgenes arelocated onX-chromosomes andthus theability tosee
colors depends entirely ontheX-chromosome .The possible combinations
